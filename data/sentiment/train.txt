2	I need to get up early tomorrow and finally see Ant-Man.  My local cinema only has one showing and it is just after 12pm.
0	@steveucnlive David price done the same thing. And got his cunt kicked in a 2nd time
1	"After going +5 on the 1st 4 holes (including a QUADRUPLE bogey on 1), Dustin Johnson is -7 for his next 8."
1	I think if I wake up one day and realize that I am not married to Frank Ocean I may lose my mind.
1	In 4th year when nowt was more important than Nirvana I wrote a bit about why Kurt Cobain didn't kill himself lol http://t.co/C2ESUkIHml
1	"...I KNOW the sexy pick for NL ROTY is Kris Bryant .257/16/66 1st rd., but Matt Duffy? .310/10/59 18th rd. ...Duffy has more hits overall..."
2	Ooohh Yeah I just remembered... I'M GOING TO RAW TOMORROW!!!!!!! UNDERTAKER AND BROCK LESNAR!!!!!!!!! #RAWMinneapolis
2	@ajhmate Hey Andrew! When the new season starts--you guys need to have on Audrey Middleton! She was the 1st transgender on Big Brother!
1	"Mar, do you know that Caitlyn Jenner still has a ball sack? - my 7yr old cousin.."

1	Not often when you see Dustin Johnson going low on a Sunday
2	"Dustin Johnson makes an eagle on 16 to move to -13. He may not have a major, but boy is he wonderful to watch when on song. #USPGA"
1	What a joke of a scorecard by Dustin Johnson. -4 today with a quadruple bogey 8 on the par 4 1st.  2 eagles on the back 9. #PGAChampionship
1	If Dustin Johnson had pared the 1st hole he'd be 17 under right now
1	"If Dustin Johnson makes par at the 1st instead of quad, we have a ball game. He's still fun to watch"
1	Dustin Johnson's scorecard is ridiculous. Starts with a snowman on the 1st hole. Since then hes added 2 eagles and 4 birdies
1	Brawler Martin Maulers came all the way from Prince George to get #lockedin for their 20th anniversary. Can they get out before their 21st?!
1	WTF!!! Frank Ocean's album has been out since June 30th and I'm just finding out!!! How??????
2	"I'll see Paper Towns tomorrow with some friends, can't wait"
2	Some round from Dustin Johnson considering he started with an 8 on the 1st. Another case of what might've been for him at Whistling Straits.
1	#USPGA Man totally oblivious to Dustin Johnson's tee shot landing beside him at the 17th. #foreleft
1	Dustin Johnson is -8 over the last 14 holes.  Oh for that quad on the 1st....

1	I have no idea what to wear tomorrow to the Sam smith concert.. Need to go shopping but hate shopping. Ugh
0	Why is Muhammad a myth.? If not then Muslims should welcome historians to do their job. I say they are afraid of what the historian may find
1	Kudos to Dustin Johnson for finishing with a 69 after starting the day with a quadruple bogey. An 8 on the 1st could've led to an 80+ easy.
1	Dear @paddypower any chance you can pay out 7th place on dustin johnson after his comeback today #justiceforjohnsonbackers
1	@highoffHAZEE only thing that is guaranteed of tomorrow is the finishing off of any Christians left in the M.E...Hazel wallah you're giving
2	Can't wait for Paper Towns and Nandos on Thursday with the lasses :) should shine some light over our results :)))
1	"I know it's just preseason but do I still get free Dunkin tomorrow, or nahhhh?"
2	Dustin Johnson straight dominating the majors on Thursday and Friday and folding on the weekend. #boogersugarftw
1	"Just your typical Sunday ...Spieth and Day there in the end, while Dustin Johnson falls apart in his final round"
2	Look for Carly Fiorina to take Donald Trump on - she may win - we shall see.
1	What if Caitlyn Jenner is actually the worlds ultimate April Fools joke?
1	Ryan Braun hit a grand slam and finished with five RBI in Sunday's 6-1 win over the Phillies.

1	Send me Lwanga's hw packet and I will buy you Dunkin tomorrow morning
2	"@JamesFenn90 Like you say, Rory, Spieth, Rose and Day should be great to watch. If Dustin Johnson can get his head together he may join them"
1	"Dustin Johnson flies out of the blocks at every major, but he simply cannot get it right on a Sunday."

0	I have an uneasy feeling..last 2 times I felt this way was day before the attitude article &amp; when Briana came to London..I may be wrong tho
2	Regardless of what happens- Thor's recovery from the 1st and his middle innings here give me hope for the future #LGM #Mets

2	"I knew that Escobar attacks 1st pitches, so there you go, hit this one.. Thor is a real life hero. #LGM"
2	"Thor is the man, this guy may have single handidly just turned this around with that first pitch"
2	I like how Thor is bragging about making Esky uncomfortable as if he didn't give up 6 hits and 3 runs in 1st 2 innings.
1	@Lou_Pellegrino you must have heard thor's comments on the 1st pitch he's not afraid that much we know
2	Thor is a throw back kind of pitcher. I love it!!!!  https://t.co/EAm51LNbHR
